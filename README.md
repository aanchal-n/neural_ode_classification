# ECG Classification

## Problem Statement
As the field of deep learning matures, better and faster neural network architectures are likely to be researched and deployed in industry. In this project, we investigate one such state-of-the-art architecture called Neural ODEs. We compare it to its predecessor, the residual neural network or ResNet. Differences in training/testing time, memory, and accuracy will be noted in the context of a supervised learning task, namely the classification of an ECG signal.

## Executive Summary
We implement both the Nueral ODE and ResNet architectures for classification of electrocardiogram signals. The data is taken from the frequently used MIT-BIH ECG database, which contains over 100,000 labeled samples of ECG signals from a single heartbeat. We train both models paying close attention training time and then evaluate them on the testing set. Comparisons are made between the two archictectures.
